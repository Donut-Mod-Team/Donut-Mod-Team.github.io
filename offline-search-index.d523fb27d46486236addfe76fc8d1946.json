[{"body":" A list with descriptions of the features and settings currently available in the mod is presented on this page. Content:\nFeatures:\n Selecting data Click-hold-drag selection Unselect data MouseOver Tooltip Center text Label ratios Negative values Dynamic Visualization Outlined Hover on MouseOver Settings menu  Settings:\n Show Labels For (...) Show In Labels (...) Labels Position (...) Circle Type (...)   Features:\n Left Mouse and Ctrl-Clicking subsets of data.  Left Mouse clicking a subset of data will produce the highlighting of data seen in the chart on the left, whilst holding ctrl whilst clicking subsets of data will produce the highlighting on the right.\nClick-hold-drag selection for multiple subsets.  Left Mouse holding and moving the mouse to cover the desired subsets, then releasing, will select all subsets that were present in the rectangular selection. Unselect by clicking the mod background (canvas).  By clicking anywhere on the canvas, in this example the white background around the Chart, the selection as seen on the left, will be unselected and the mod will go back to looking like it does when no subsets are selected, as seen on the right. Tooltip with dynamic information on mouseOver.  Hovering over a sector will create an outline of the sector, as well as display a tooltip with information about the sector that is currently being hovered. Dynamic sum of values as center text.  The center text available in the mod will give relevant information about the data that is currently selected on the chart. Either the whole set, as seen to the right, or one to several subsets, as seen in the two rightmost images. Labels showing ratios on each sector.  The labels inside the sectors tell the users which percentage of the data set is present inside the subset. Red lines visualizing negative values.  On the outer part of a sector, the red line indicates that a value is negative rather than positive. This is to help the user navigate negative and positive values more easily. Dynamic visualization based on sector and donut size.  Depending on the sizes of the sectors and the mod itself, different behaviours are expected within the Donut Chart. Some of these are the removal of labels when sectors are too small (middle) and the shortening of the center value name (right).\nOutlined hover-effect when hovering a sector.  When hovering a sector, as shown in the tooltip subsection, there is an outline present around the sector that you are currently hovering, which indicates the current sector.\nSettings for adapting different visualization aspects of the mod.  To change the way the mod is visualized, press the circled settings icon on the left, and a dropdown should appear of options that will change the look and placements of different aspects of your mod. Each of these settings are described underneath this section.\n Settings:\nShow labels for:\n All  Selecting \"Show labels for: All\" will show labels for all sectors.\nMarked rows  Selecting \"Show labels for: Marked Rows\" will show labels for all sectors that are marked, and none when no specific sector(s) have been marked.\nNone  Selecting \"Show labels for: None\" will display no labels for any sectors, wether they have been selected or not.\n Show in labels:\n Sector percentage  Selecting \"Show in labels: Sector Percentage\" will display the labels as a percentage.\nSector value  Selecting \"Show in labels: Sector Value\" will display the labels as the value of the corresponding sector.\nSector category  Selecting \"Show in labels: Sector Category\" will display the labels as the category of the current sector.\nMultiple values  You can also select multiple different values when choosing how to display the sector values, for instance Sector Category and Sector Values at the same time, or any (or all) combinations of the settings in the following subsection.\n Labels position:\n Inside donut  Selecting \"Labels position: Inside donut\" will display the labels inside the Donut Chart.\nOutside donut  Selecting \"Labels position: Outside donut\" will display the labels outside of the Donut Chart.\n Sorting:\n Sort sectors by size  Unselecting \"Sorting: Sort sectors by size\" will remove the sorting done by size on the sectors. It is important to note that this disables the following two settings, as well.\nSort sectors ascending  Selecting \"Sorting: Sort sectors ascending\" will sort the sectors in ascending order.\nSort sectors descending  Selecting \"Sorting: Sort sectors descending\" will sort the sectors in descending order.\n Circle type:\n Visualize whole circle  Selecting \"Circle type: Visualize whole circle\" will visualize the Donut Chart as a whole circle.  Visualize semi-circle  Selecting \"Circle type: Visualize semi-circle\" will visualize the Donut Chart as a semi-circle.

To get Tibco Spotfire, you can move to their home page where you can start a trial or get started with a membership.  If you wish to download the source code found on GitHub, you also need to have node.js installed on your machine in order use the mod. A description of how to do this, written by Tibco themselves, can be found here. Get Started! -- How do I download it?  To download the mod, there are two options. The first option, which is also the easiest, is to download and use the release. The other option is to download the source code and run it on a development server. The second option is required if you wish to make changes to the mod. 1. Release Download\nTo download the release, first head to the GitHub Release Page. Here you will want to grab the latest release, which should have the highest vesion number, for instance 0.1.1.\nOnce you have downloaded the release, you want to start up Spotfire. Now you have two options. Firstly, you can drag and drop the mod-file (the one you just downloaded) into the Spotfire canvas. The other option is to click on the three bars on the left side, which will open a pop-up menu. In this pop-up menu, click on the three dots in the top right, select \"Browse for Visualiation\" and find the mod-file. You should now see the visualization in your client! 2. Source Code Download\nTo download the source code, navigate to GitHub and click the code button to download the code using your preffered method. Next you need to install node.js, which is described on their website found here. After you have downloaded the code and installed node.js, you want to navigate to the project code folder in two terminals, and run: 1. npm start 2. npm run server  Once you have executed these commands, your development server is up and running. In order to connect it to Spotfire®, there are a couple of steps we need to execute.  Firstly, make sure Spotfire® is set to editing instead of viewing mode. Next, you want to click Tools  Development  Create visualization mod... In the canvas that just popped up, you want to click \"Connect to project\". Then click Development Server, enter the url that you got in your terminal when setting up the server, and connect. Now you should be able to see the mod in your local Spotfire®!
