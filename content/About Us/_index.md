    <h1>About Us:</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The team consists of four third-year students from the University of Gothenburg, which all specialize in different areas of interest. The team members were introduced to each other through the duration of their studies in the University, and started working closer together during the development of this mod.</p>
    <p> Throughout the project, the team members have taken on different roles in the development cycle, and all have different areas that they are more familiar and comfortable with. </p>
    <p>Chrysostomos has focused on the development of the mod itself, as well as testing and the CI/CD development. Clementine primarily works as the project manager and UX design, as well as working with some development aspects. Eemil also focuses on the project management, as well as working as a developer. Krasen has the main role with the testing, as well as CI/CD and development. </p>
