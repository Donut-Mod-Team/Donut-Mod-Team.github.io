<p>
	A list with descriptions of the features and settings currently available in the mod is presented on this page. 
</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Left Mouse and Ctrl-Clicking subsets of data.</li>
  <img src="left-click-ctrl-click.png" alt="Left Mouse and Ctrl-clicking subsets of data.">
  <p> Left Mouse clicking a subset of data will produce the highlighting of data seen in the chart on the left, whilst holding ctrl whilst clicking subsets of data will produce the highlighting on the right.</p>
  
  <li>Click-hold-drag selection for multiple subsets.</li>
  <img src="click-hold-drag.png" alt="Click-hold-drag selecting multiple subsets.">
  <p> Left Mouse holding and moving the mouse to cover the desired subsets, then releasing, will select all subsets that were present in the rectangular selection. </p>
  
  <li>Unselect by clicking the mod background (canvas).</li>
  <img src="unselecting-canvas.png" alt="Unselect by clicking the mod background (canvas).">
  <p> By clicking anywhere on the canvas, in this example the white background around the Chart, the selection as seen on the left, will be unselected and the mod will go back to looking like it does when no subsets are selected, as seen on the right. </p>
  
  <li>Tooltip with dynamic information on mouseOver.</li>
  <img src="mouseover-tooltip.png" alt="Tooltip and hovering outline example.">
  <p> Hovering over a sector will create an outline of the sector, as well as display a tooltip with information about the sector that is currently being hovered. </p>
  
  <li>Dynamic sum of values as center text.</li>
  <img src="center-text.png" alt="Center text example.">
  <p> The center text available in the mod will give relevant information about the data that is currently selected on the chart. Either the whole set, as seen to the right, or one to several subsets, as seen in the two rightmost images. </p>
  
  <li>Labels showing ratios on each sector.</li>
  <img src="sector-labels.png" alt="Labels inside sectors.">
  <p> The labels inside the sectors tell the users which percentage of the data set is present inside the subset. </p>
  
  <li>Red lines visualizing negative values.</li>
  <img src="negative-values.png" alt="Negative values outlined.">
  <p> On the outer part of a sector, the red line indicates that a value is negative rather than positive. This is to help the user navigate negative and positive values more easily. </p>
  
  <li>Dynamic visualization based on sector and donut size.</li>
  <img src="dynamic-visualization.png" alt="Different mod and sector resizings.">
  <p> Depending on the sizes of the sectors and the mod itself, different behaviours are expected within the Donut Chart. Some of these are the removal of labels when sectors are too small (middle) and the shortening of the center value name (right).</p>
	
  <li>Outlined hover-effect when hovering a sector.</li>
  <img src="mouseover-tooltip.png" alt="MouseOver outline when hovering.">
  <p> When hovering a sector, as shown in the tooltip subsection, there is an outline present around the sector that you are currently hovering, which indicates the current sector.</p>
  
  <li>Settings for adapting different visualization aspects of the mod.</li>
  <img src="settings-menu.png" alt="Settings menu in the mod.">
  <p> To change the way the mod is visualized, press the circled settings icon on the left, and a dropdown should appear of options that will change the look and placements of different aspects of your mod. Each of these settings are described underneath this section.</p>
