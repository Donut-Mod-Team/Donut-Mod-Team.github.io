If you are looking to add to the project, or simply want to describe missing features, working with us is most easily done through GitHub.

To discuss an issue, or something missing, adding a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/Donut-Mod-Team/donut-mod/issues) will peak our interest, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

As for contributing to the project yourself, forking the repository and adding a pull request will allow us to review what you have done, and discuss it internally within the team.
