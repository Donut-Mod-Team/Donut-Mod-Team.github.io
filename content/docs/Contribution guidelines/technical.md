To work with the project and set up a development server, you will need to [follow this guide](https://tibcosoftware.github.io/spotfire-mods/docs/getting-started/) provided by Tibco for working with mods. 

You will need, as described in the aforementioned guide, to have Node.js installed, a code editor, and a working instance of Spotfire®. The mod is functional with all browsers that can run the browser version of Spotfire®.

Forking the project to work with it locally will provide to be the most efficient if you wish to contribute to the main project, or simply work with the mod for yourself, which is also discussed in the Future Improvements section in this subsection of the docs.
