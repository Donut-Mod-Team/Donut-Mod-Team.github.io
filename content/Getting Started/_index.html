<p>
	To use the mod, a working instance of Tibco Spotfire is necessary. This could be either the desktop client <a href="https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-spotfire">Tibco Spotfire® Analyst</a>, or the web client, TIBCO Spotfire® Business Author.

	If you wish to download the source code found on <a href="https://github.com/Donut-Mod-Team/donut-mod">GitHub</a>, you also need to have node.js installed on your machine in order use the mod.

<h2 id="how-to-download">How do I download it?</h2>
<p>
	To download the mod, there are two options. The first option, which is also the easiest, is to download and use the release. The other option is to download the source code and run it on a development server. The second option is required if you wish to make changes to the mod.
</p>
<br>

<p>1. Release Download</p>
<p>To download the release, first head to the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Donut-Mod-Team/donut-mod/releases">Release Page</a>. Here you will want to grab the latest release, which should have the highest vesion number, for instance 0.1.1.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the release, you want to start up Spotfire. Now you have two options. Firstly, you can drag and drop the mod-file (the one you just downloaded) into the Spotfire canvas. The other option is to click on the three bars on the left side, which will open a pop-up menu. In this pop-up menu, click on the three dots in the top right, select "Browse for Visualiation" and find the mod-file. You should now see the visualization in your client! </p>
<br>

<p>2. Source Code Download</p>
